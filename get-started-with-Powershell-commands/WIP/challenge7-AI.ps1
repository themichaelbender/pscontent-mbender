# Introduction: 
# As a system administrator, it's essential to be able to troubleshoot and resolve issues that users face. One common problem users encounter is difficulty accessing a computer remotely using Remote Desktop. In this step-by-step guide, we will use PowerShell to investigate and resolve the issue by examining the Windows Firewall settings.

**Step 1: Finding the Windows Firewall Cmdlet**
The first step is to find the appropriate cmdlet in PowerShell that allows us to manage the Windows Firewall. To do this, open the PowerShell console as an administrator and enter the following commands:
```powershell

Get-Command -Name *Fire*
Get-Command -Name Get-*Fire*
Get-Command -Name Get-NetFire*
help Get-NetFirewallRule
```
These commands will help us identify the cmdlet required to work with the Windows Firewall.

**Step 2: Exploring Objects with Get-Member**
To gain a better understanding of the objects related to the Windows Firewall, we can use the `Get-Member` cmdlet. Execute the following commands in the PowerShell console:
```powershell
Get-NetFirewallRule | gm
Get-NetFirewallRule
```
These commands will provide information about the objects associated with the Windows Firewall and display the existing firewall rules.

**Step 3: Retrieving Remote Desktop Firewall Rules**
Now that we are familiar with the Windows Firewall objects, we can retrieve the firewall rules specific to Remote Desktop. Execute the following commands:
```powershell
Get-NetFirewallRule -Name *Remote* 
Get-NetFirewallRule -Name *RemoteDesktop* 
Get-NetFirewallRule -Name *RemoteDesktop* | Format-Table -Property Name,Enabled,Profile,Direction,Action
```
These commands will fetch the firewall rules related to Remote Desktop, helping us determine if any rules are blocking remote access.

**Step 4: Modifying the Firewall Rule**
To enable Remote Desktop through the Windows Firewall, we can use the pipeline feature of PowerShell. Execute the following commands:
```powershell
Get-NetFirewallRule -Name *RemoteDesktop* | Set-NetFirewallRule -Enabled 'True' -Whatif
Get-NetFirewallRule -Name *RemoteDesktop* | FT
```
These commands will enable the Remote Desktop firewall rule by setting the `-Enabled` parameter to 'True.' The `-WhatIf` parameter is used to simulate the changes without actually applying them.

**Conclusion:**
By following these steps, we have successfully used PowerShell to troubleshoot Remote Desktop issues related to the Windows Firewall. We explored the available cmdlets, examined objects associated with the Windows Firewall, retrieved the Remote Desktop firewall rules, and modified the necessary rule to enable Remote Desktop access. PowerShell's flexibility and automation capabilities empower system administrators to efficiently diagnose and resolve various system issues.
