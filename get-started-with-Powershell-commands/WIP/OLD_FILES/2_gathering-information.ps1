# Lab 1 - PowerShell: Getting Started
# Module - Gathering Information with PowerShell

##### Notes and helpful Items - PLEASE READ #####
# USE ALT+Z to toggle Word Wrap on the remarks for easier reading in VS Code.

# Unless specified, Windows PowerShell and PowerShell 7 consoles need to be launced as Administrator using 'run as administrator' option by right-clicking icon.

# The lab environment has a single client (Client01) and a domain controller (DC01).

# The lab environment has no internet access so actions requiring the Internet will not be performed.

# All remote actions performed with Client02 as a target in the video course demos will be performed with DC01 instead.

# The commands below are not intended to be run in VS Code. They are intended to be type (preferred) or copy/pasted into the PowerShell console used in each demo.

# Read all of the remarks (hash-tagged green lines) as non-command steps and information is included throughout this script.

# Some demo commands have been modified to work within the lab environment. They will perform the same general tasks, but may have different references such as file directories. Also, any tasks requiring internet access will be skipped.

# Use of cls in code is to clear-host or clear the screen during demos. This can be skipped during your labs if desired.
